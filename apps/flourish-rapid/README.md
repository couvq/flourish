# flourish-rapid

This package is the rapid development environment to test the flourish-ui package locally. It is simple as it just contains a react-router with a homepage of links to various pages where we render our component examples, this is used to run integration tests and accessibility tests to ensure our components work as expected before we publish new versions of the flourish-ui package to npm for consumers to use.

### How to run this package

1. Global install so that we pick up the latest flourish-ui locally.
2. `npm run dev` to open up the vite dev server locally
